## CyberFinalProject
By Lillian Tran and Kirsten Szeto

## Project Description:
  Cross site scripting is a widely used technique to exploit vulnerabilities in websites. Using cross site scripting (XSS) the attacker is able to execute malicious javascript in the target's browser.

  During our lesson, we will teach students about the history, development, and use of XSS attacks. We will have them play around with simple examples and provide them with a more complicated script to use. The complicated script will be coded by us and shared after basic examples are understood by the class.

  After the lesson, we will share preventative measures on how to safeguard against these kinds of attacks.

  This presentation should last about 15+ minutes.

## Deliverables:
  Presentation slides with background information
  Simple codes sequences for demo
  Full XSS script to practice with

## To do:
  everything
